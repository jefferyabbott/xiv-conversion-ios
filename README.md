# XIV Conversion
## iOS

XIV Conversion is a simple app that converts roman numerals (such as XIV) to arabic/cardinal numbers (such as 14).  For the past several years as I've been learning how to program, I have been using this utility as my own *Hello, World* example.  Any time I learn a new programming language, I build this app, from scratch.  The first version was released in 2013 (I think) for iOS.  Since then, I have created and released versions for Android (Java) and the web (JavaScript).

This is version 4.0 of the app.  
Improvements include:
- Complete redesign of the logic/algorithms for vastly improved performance
- Better UI with AutoLayout so the app looks good on any screen size
- Smart roman numeral keypad hides buttons when their use would be invalid
- Implementation of a "single View Controller" as a container for the app UI

Previous versions of the app, and how they are different:
- version 1 was my first app ever published, written in Objective-C
- version 2 was a re-write of the app in Swift
- version 3 included a UI redesign using AutoLayout

If you have ideas for improvements, please feel free to contribute!
